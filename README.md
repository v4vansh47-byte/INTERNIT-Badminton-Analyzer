🏸 INTER-NIT Badminton Analyzer (Professional Edition)
This Python project provides a comprehensive tool to analyze and predict badminton match outcomes for players and teams across various National Institutes of Technology (NITs) in India. It features a simulated database of 75 players from 15 NITs, historical INTER-NIT tournament rankings, and a prediction engine to simulate singles matches and best-of-5 team matchups.
Whether you're a player looking to see how you stack up, a fan curious about potential match outcomes, or simply interested in data-driven sports analysis, this tool offers insights into the competitive landscape of inter-college badminton.
✨ Features
 * Extensive Player Database: A simulated database of 75 unique players from 15 different NITs, each with their own performance statistics (tournaments played, matches won, finals reached, trophies won).
 * 5-Year Historical Rankings: Browse the top 3 rankings of the INTER-NIT Badminton Tournament from 2020 to 2024.
 * Player Strength Calculation: A dynamic "Strength Score" is calculated for each player based on their accumulated stats, allowing for quantitative comparison.
 * Singles Match Prediction: Simulate a one-on-one match between any two players from the database (or against your own custom player profile) and visualize their win probabilities.
 * Team Matchup Simulation: Predict the outcome of a "Best-of-5" singles matchup between any two NIT teams, simulating 10,000 matches to provide a robust win probability.
 * Personalized Player Profile: Add your own badminton statistics and compare your performance against any player in the database.
 * Interactive Command-Line Interface: Easy-to-use menu-driven interface for seamless navigation and interaction.
 * Visual Predictions: Matplotlib graphs display win probabilities clearly, making predictions easy to understand at a glance.

📊 Prediction Logic
The prediction engine is based on a "Strength Score" calculated for each player using a weighted sum of their statistics:
\\text{Strength Score} = (\\text{Trophies Won} \\times 25) + (\\text{Finals Reached} \\times 10) + (\\text{Matches Won} \\times 2) + (\\text{Tournaments Played} \\times 1)
For a singles match between Player 1 (P1) and Player 2 (P2), the win probability for P1 is calculated as:
P(\\text{P1 Wins}) = \\frac{\\text{Strength Score}*{\\text{P1}}}{\\text{Strength Score}*{\\text{P1}} + \\text{Strength Score}\_{\\text{P2}}}
Team matchups are simulated 10,000 times as a best-of-5 singles format, with the top 5 players from each team participating. The team with 3 or more individual match wins is declared the winner of that simulation. The final team win probability is the percentage of simulations won by the respective team.
🤝 Contributing
This project is a great starting point for further enhancements! Feel free to fork the repository and contribute:
 * Expand the Database: Add more players and NITs.
 * Refine Strength Calculation: Experiment with different weighting schemes for player stats.
 * Advanced Prediction Models: Implement more sophisticated machine learning models for predictions.
 * GUI Development: Convert the CLI to a graphical user interface using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt.
 * New Features: Add functionality for doubles matches, tournament bracket simulations, etc.
